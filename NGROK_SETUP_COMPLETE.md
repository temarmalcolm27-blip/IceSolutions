## 🎙️ How Conversational AI Works Now

### When You Make a Call:

1. **Twilio dials the number** from (229) 600-5631
2. **Call connects** to your WebSocket server via ngrok
3. **OpenAI Realtime API** handles the conversation
4. **Audio streams in real-time** both directions
5. **Marcus listens and responds** naturally

### What You'll Experience:

**Marcus will:**
- ✅ Greet the person warmly
- ✅ Ask to speak with the purchasing manager
- ✅ Listen to their response and adapt
- ✅ Ask qualifying questions
- ✅ Handle objections professionally
- ✅ Respond to questions naturally
- ✅ Close for a sale or follow-up

**You can:**
- ✅ Interrupt Marcus anytime
- ✅ Ask questions and get answers
- ✅ Raise objections and hear rebuttals
- ✅ Have a natural back-and-forth conversation
- ✅ Test different scenarios

## 🚀 Making More Calls

### Call a Single Lead
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/call/876-XXX-XXXX?lead_name=Business%20Name"
```

### Call Multiple Leads (Script)
```bash
# Get all uncalled leads
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads" | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A 5 '"status": "New"'

# Call each one
# (Manually or create a script to automate)
```

### Use Interactive Helper
```bash
/app/test_calls_helper.sh
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Testing

### 1. Record Calls (Enable in Twilio)
- Go to Twilio Console
- Enable call recording
- Listen back to see how Marcus performed

### 2. Test Different Scenarios
- Friendly businesses (best response)
- Busy businesses (handling objections)
- Competitive businesses (qualification)
- Not interested (graceful exit)

### 3. Monitor Conversation Quality
- Are Marcus's responses relevant?
- Does he handle interruptions well?
- Is the qualification effective?
- Do objection responses work?

### 4. Iterate on the Script
- Edit `/app/backend/conversational_ai.py`
- Update `MARCUS_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS`
- Restart: `sudo supervisorctl restart websocket`
- Test again

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Call Connects But No Voice:
```bash
# Check WebSocket logs
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/websocket.out.log

# Check for OpenAI connection errors
grep -i "error" /var/log/supervisor/websocket.out.log

# Restart WebSocket server
sudo supervisorctl restart websocket
```

### If Ngrok Disconnects:
```bash
# Check ngrok status
curl -s http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels | python3 -m json.tool

# Restart ngrok
pkill ngrok
nohup ngrok http 8080 > /tmp/ngrok.log 2>&1 &

# Get new URL and update .env
# Restart services
sudo supervisorctl restart all
```

### If Conversation Quality is Poor:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Monitor API usage/quota
- Review conversation logs for errors

---

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### Current Setup Costs:
- **Twilio**: ~$0.01/minute
- **OpenAI Realtime API**: ~$0.06/minute
- **Total**: ~$0.07/minute per call

### For 100 Calls (3 min average):
- 100 calls × 3 min = 300 minutes
- 300 min × $0.07 = **$21/month**

### ROI Calculation:
- Average order: JMD $3,500 (10 bags)
- If 10% convert: 10 orders = JMD $35,000
- Cost: ~$21 USD (~JMD $3,300)
- **Net profit: JMD $31,700** 🎉
