# Ice Solutions Lead Management & Sales Agent Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through setting up your complete lead generation and automated sales calling system.

## üéØ System Overview

Your Ice Solutions platform now includes:
1. **Lead Scraper**: Generates business leads in target Kingston areas
2. **Google Sheets Integration**: Stores and manages leads
3. **Twilio AI Sales Agent** (Marcus): Automatically calls leads to sell ice
4. **Call Result Tracking**: Logs outcomes back to Google Sheets
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Monitor lead stats and performance

## üìã Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, make sure you have:
- ‚úÖ Twilio Account (SID, Auth Token, Phone Number) - Already configured!
- ‚úÖ Google Sheets API credentials - Already configured!
- ‚úÖ Google Sheet created - Already exists!
- ‚è≥ Google Apps Script webhook - Needs setup (10 minutes)

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Google Sheets Structure

1. **Open your Google Sheet**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wK3hgflRMOvvdnKXG2aFcqKo3ytsIz7GcvaCM_1sId8/edit

2. **Add these exact column headers in Row 1**:
   ```
   Business Name | Phone | Address | Type | Area | Status | Call Date | Call Notes | Result
   ```

3. **Share with service account**:
   - Click "Share" button
   - Add this email: `icesolutions-agent@temarvoiceagent.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
   - Give it "Editor" permissions
   - Click "Send"

### Step 2: Deploy Google Apps Script Webhook

üìñ **Follow the detailed instructions in**: `/app/GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK.md`

**Quick summary**:
1. Open your Google Sheet ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script
2. Copy the webhook code from the guide
3. Deploy as Web App (Anyone can access)
4. Copy the webhook URL
5. Update `.env` file if URL is different

**Test the webhook**:
```bash
curl "YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL?action=health"
```

Expected: `{"status":"ok","message":"Ice Solutions Lead Webhook is running"}`

### Step 3: Generate Your First Leads

Now that everything is set up, let's generate some leads!

**Option A: Generate Sample Leads (Quick Test)**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/scrape?count=10"
```

This will:
- Generate 10 sample businesses
- Add them to your Google Sheet
- Store them in your database
- Ready to be called!

**Option B: Generate Leads for Specific Areas**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/scrape?count=20" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Target specific areas:
- Washington Gardens
- Duhaney Park
- Patrick City
- Pembrook Hall

**Option C: Manual Lead Entry**
Add leads directly to your Google Sheet with these columns filled in:
- Business Name: "Sunset Bar & Grill"
- Phone: "876-555-1234"
- Address: "123 Main Road, Washington Gardens, Kingston"
- Type: "bar" or "restaurant" or "shop" etc.
- Area: "Washington Gardens"
- Status: "New"
- Leave other columns blank

### Step 4: Sync Leads from Google Sheets

After adding leads manually or via scraping, sync them to your backend:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/sync"
```

This will:
- Read all "New" leads from your Google Sheet
- Add them to your database
- Make them available for calling

### Step 5: Make Your First Sales Call!

**Call a single lead**:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/call/876-555-1234?lead_name=Sunset%20Bar"
```

What happens:
1. Marcus (AI agent) calls the number
2. Delivers the sales pitch about ice delivery
3. Updates lead status in database
4. You can log results manually

**View all your leads**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads"
```

**Check lead statistics**:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/stats"
```

### Step 6: Update Lead Results After Calls

After Marcus calls a lead, update the result:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/update/876-555-1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "Interested",
    "call_notes": "Owner interested in weekly delivery of 10 bags",
    "result": "Follow up next week"
  }'
```

This updates both the database AND your Google Sheet!

## üìä Monitoring & Management

### View Lead Stats

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/stats"
```

Returns:
- Total leads
- Breakdown by status (New, Contacted, Interested, Sold, Not Interested)
- Leads by area
- Leads by business type

### Check All Leads

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads"
```

Returns all leads in your database with full details.

### Sync Latest from Google Sheets

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8001/api/leads/sync"
```

Pulls any new leads you've added manually to the sheet.

## üéôÔ∏è Sales Agent Script

Marcus (your AI sales agent) follows this script:

**Opening**:
> "Hello, this is Marcus from Ice Solutions. We provide party ice deliveries for businesses in the corporate area and Kingston at a reasonable price."

**Key Points**:
- Premium restaurant-quality ice
- JMD $350 per 10lb bag
- Bulk discounts: 5%, 10%, 15%
- FREE delivery in Washington Gardens
- Same-day delivery available
- Order online or cash on delivery

**Objection Handling**:

You can view/modify the script in: `/app/backend/sales_agent_script.py`

## üåê Production Considerations

### For Real Lead Scraping (Not Sample Data)

The current system uses sample data generation. For production:

**Option 1: Google Places API** (Recommended)
- Most reliable and accurate
- Costs ~$17 per 1,000 queries
- Setup guide: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview

**Option 2: Web Scraping**
- Jamaica Yellow Pages
- Google Maps (via SerpAPI)
- Social media business pages
- Requires legal compliance and rate limiting

**Option 3: Purchase Business Lists**
- Jamaica Chamber of Commerce
- Business directories
- Verified and accurate data

**Option 4: Manual Research**
- Quality over quantity
- Personal verification
- Best for initial pilot

### Legal Considerations

- ‚úÖ Only call businesses (not consumers)
- ‚úÖ Respect do-not-call lists
- ‚úÖ Provide opt-out option
- ‚úÖ Store data securely
- ‚úÖ Comply with Jamaica's telemarketing laws

### Scaling Up

When you're ready to scale:
1. Automate calling workflow (call all "New" leads daily)
2. Set up call scheduling (best times to reach businesses)
3. Implement follow-up system (callback reminders)
4. A/B test different scripts
5. Track conversion rates by area/type
