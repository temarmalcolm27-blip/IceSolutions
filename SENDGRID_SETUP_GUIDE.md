   ```
   # SendGrid Email Configuration
   SMTP_SERVER="smtp.sendgrid.net"
   SMTP_PORT="587"
   SENDER_EMAIL="orders@icesolutions.com"
   SENDER_PASSWORD="YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE"
   ```

3. **Replace YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY_HERE with your actual API key**
   - Paste the full API key you copied (starts with SG.)
   - Make sure SENDER_EMAIL matches the verified email from Step 3
   - Example:
   ```
   SENDER_PASSWORD="SG.abc123xyz789..."
   ```

4. **Save the file**
   - Press Ctrl+X
   - Press Y to confirm
   - Press Enter to save

### Step 5: Restart Backend Server

sudo supervisorctl restart backend
```

Wait a few seconds for the server to restart.

   ```bash
   tail -n 50 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log | grep -i email
   ```
   Look for:
   - "Confirmation email sent successfully" = Working! ‚úÖ
   - "Failed to send confirmation email" = Error ‚ùå

2. **Verify SendGrid API Key**
   - Make sure you copied the entire key (starts with SG.)
   - No extra spaces or quotes in the .env file
   - Sender email matches verified email in SendGrid

3. **Check SendGrid Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/

   - You'll see all sent emails and their delivery status
