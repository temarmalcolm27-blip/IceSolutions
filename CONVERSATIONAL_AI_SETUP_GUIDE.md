```

**Required Changes to Your Backend**:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install websockets openai-realtime
```

2. Create WebSocket endpoint:
```python
# New file: /app/backend/realtime_agent.py
from openai import OpenAI
import websockets
import json

async def handle_call(websocket):
    # Connect to OpenAI Realtime API
    client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
    
    # Configure Marcus's personality and script
    system_prompt = """
    You are Marcus, a friendly sales representative for Ice Solutions 
    in Kingston, Jamaica. Your goal is to:

    Be conversational, friendly, and professional.
    Handle objections politely. If they're busy, offer to call back.
    """
    
    # Handle real-time conversation
    # (Full implementation in separate guide)
```

3. Update Twilio call to use Media Streams:

    to=phone_formatted,
    from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
    url="YOUR_WEBSOCKET_URL/media-stream"
)
```

**Estimated Development Time**: 2-3 days
**Cost**: ~$0.06/minute + Twilio costs

### OPTION 2: ElevenLabs Voice Cloning Implementation

**Step 1: Record Your Voice**

Record yourself saying these scripts naturally:

**Script 1: Introduction**
```
Hello! Good afternoon. My name is Marcus, and I'm calling from Ice Solutions 
here in Kingston. How are you doing today? I wanted to reach out because we 
specialize in premium ice delivery for businesses like yours.
```

**Script 2: Product Description**
```
We deliver crystal-clear, restaurant-quality ice in convenient 10-pound bags. 
Our pricing starts at just 350 Jamaican dollars per bag, and we offer 
significant bulk discounts. For orders of 20 bags or more, you save 15 percent.
```

**Script 3: Handling Objections**
```
I completely understand. Many of our current clients said the same thing 
initially. But what they found is that our ice quality and delivery reliability 
actually saves them money in the long run. Would you be open to just trying 
one delivery to see the difference?
```

**Script 4: Closing**
```
Excellent! I'm going to put you down for that. We can deliver as early as 
tomorrow. What time works best for you? And just to confirm, this is for 
your location at [address], correct?
