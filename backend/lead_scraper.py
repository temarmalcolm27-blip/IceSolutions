WEB SCRAPING IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:

To implement actual web scraping for lead generation, you'll need to:

1. Install Required Libraries:
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml selenium

2. Target Websites:
   - Jamaica Yellow Pages (https://www.jamaicayp.com/)
   - Jamaica Business Directory
   - Google Maps (use SerpAPI for legal scraping)
   - Social media business pages

3. Scraping Best Practices:
   - Respect robots.txt
   - Implement rate limiting (1-2 requests per second)
   - Use proper User-Agent headers
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Cache results to avoid repeated requests

4. Legal Considerations:
   - Check website Terms of Service
   - Consider using APIs instead of scraping
   - Use services like SerpAPI for Google Maps data
   - Obtain explicit permission when possible

5. Alternative Approaches:
   - Use Google Places API (requires billing but more reliable)
   - Purchase business directory databases
   - Partner with local business associations
   - Manual research and entry
   - Crowdsource lead collection

6. Data Privacy:
   - Only collect publicly available information
   - Comply with Jamaica's data protection laws
   - Provide opt-out mechanisms
   - Store data securely

RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR PRODUCTION:
Instead of web scraping, consider:
1. Google Places API (most reliable, requires billing)
2. Purchase verified business lists
3. Manual research with quality > quantity
4. Partner with Jamaica Chamber of Commerce
