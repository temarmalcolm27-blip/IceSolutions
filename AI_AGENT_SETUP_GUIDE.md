# IceSolutions AI Sales Agent - Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ System Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

Your AI Sales Agent is fully implemented and ready to start calling customers! Here's everything you need to know:

## What's Been Built

### âœ… Complete AI Sales Agent System
- **Automatic Callback Triggering**: Customers are called immediately after submitting quotes/orders
- **Jamaican Male Voice**: Configured with Polly.Matthew-Neural for friendly personality
- **Smart Conversation Flow**: AI agent can discuss pricing, delivery, and order confirmation
- **Database Integration**: All calls and conversations are tracked and stored
- **Admin Dashboard**: View all call attempts and quote requests

### âœ… Key Features Implemented
1. **Auto-Call on Quote Submission**: Every quote/order triggers an immediate callback
2. **Intelligent Responses**: Agent knows customer details, pricing, and can answer questions
3. **Conversation Context**: Maintains context throughout the call
4. **Call History Tracking**: All attempts logged with status and duration
5. **Graceful Error Handling**: Failed calls are logged and can be retried

## Current System Behavior

When a customer submits a quote on your website:
1. **Quote Created**: Stored in MongoDB with unique ID
2. **Background Task**: AI callback automatically triggered
3. **Twilio Call**: System attempts to call customer's phone number  
4. **AI Conversation**: Agent discusses order details and confirms delivery
5. **Call Tracking**: All interaction data saved for review

## Next Steps to Go LIVE

### 1. Set Up Public URL (Required)

The system needs a public URL for Twilio webhooks. Choose one option:

**Option A: ngrok (Quick Setup for Testing)**
```bash
# Sign up at https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
# Get your authtoken and run:
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
ngrok http 8001

# Copy the https URL (like: https://abc123.ngrok.io) 
```

**Option B: Deploy to Cloud (Production)**
- Deploy to Heroku, DigitalOcean, AWS, etc.
- Get your public domain (like: https://yourapp.herokuapp.com)

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Add to `/app/backend/.env`:
```bash
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io  # Replace with your URL
PUBLIC_DOMAIN=your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io       # Replace with your domain (no https)
```

### 3. Test the Complete System

```bash
# Restart backend after adding URLs
sudo supervisorctl restart backend

# Test quote submission (should trigger AI call)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/quotes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerInfo": {
      "name": "Your Test Name",
      "email": "test@example.com", 
      "phone": "+18764907208",
      "address": "Kingston, Jamaica"
    },
    "eventDetails": {
      "eventDate": "2025-12-25T00:00:00Z",
      "eventType": "Private Party",
      "guestCount": 25,
      "iceAmount": 0,
      "deliveryTime": "2 PM - 4 PM"
    }
  }'
```

### 4. Monitor Call Attempts

```bash
# View all call attempts
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/admin/call-attempts | jq '.[0:3]'

# View all quotes
curl -s http://localhost:8001/api/admin/quotes | jq '.[0:3]'
```

## AI Agent Conversation Flow

Your AI agent is programmed to handle:

### âœ… Greeting & Introduction
- "Hello [Name], this is a callback from Ice Solutions regarding your recent ice delivery quote..."

### âœ… Order Confirmation  
- Confirms bag quantity, pricing, and delivery details
- "Your quote is for X bags at JMD $350 each, totaling JMD $X..."

### âœ… Delivery Scheduling
- Discusses delivery areas and timing
- "We deliver to Washington Gardens (free) or anywhere outside (JMD $300 fee)..."

### âœ… Question Handling
- Answers questions about products, pricing, and delivery
- Handles cancellations and modifications gracefully

### âœ… Order Confirmation
- Collects delivery details and confirms order
- "Perfect! I'll confirm your order for X bags..."

## Troubleshooting

### If Calls Fail
1. Check call attempts: `curl http://localhost:8001/api/admin/call-attempts`
2. Verify Twilio credentials in `.env`
3. Ensure public URL is accessible
4. Check backend logs: `sudo supervisorctl tail backend`

### If Agent Doesn't Respond
1. Verify WebSocket URL in TwiML
2. Check conversation logs in database
3. Test WebSocket endpoint separately
