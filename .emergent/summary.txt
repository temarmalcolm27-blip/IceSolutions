The AI engineer has transformed the IceSolutions application significantly. Initially, the focus was on frontend enhancements like 3D ice animations, which were later refined and replaced with a static background image as per user feedback. A major pivot involved decommissioning the Twilio AI sales agent Marcus and implementing a new on-website chat widget with Temar Malcolm, trained on website content. This included creating backend LLM endpoints, integrating the frontend widget, and extensive debugging of API key usage, button visibility, and conversational logic. Concurrently, a robust order processing system was built, integrating Stripe for payments, Gmail SMTP for email confirmations with tracking links, and Google Sheets for lead and order management. Critical bugs, such as syntax errors, incorrect Google Sheets connections, and email delivery issues, were systematically identified and resolved, culminating in the current task of preventing duplicate order processing on the confirmation page.

IceSolutions is an online platform for a party ice delivery business focusing on events, restaurants, and individuals in Kingston, Jamaica. The application aims to provide a seamless user experience for ordering ice.
Current features include:
1.  **Instant Quote & Bulk Order System**: Calculates ice needs based on event details, offers volume discounts, and guides customers to checkout.
2.  **Stripe Integration**: Secure online payments.
3.  **On-Website Chat Widget (Temar Malcolm)**: Replaced a previous outbound AI agent. This AI chatbot answers product/pricing/delivery questions, generates instant quotes, and collects customer lead information (name, phone, email, product interest) for follow-up, which is sent to Google Sheets. Future functionality includes generating direct checkout links via chat.
4.  **Order Processing & Tracking**: After Stripe payment, customers receive an email confirmation with a trackable Order ID and link. Order details are saved to MongoDB and Google Sheets, with status updates (Planning, In transit, Delivered) reflected on the tracking page.
5.  **UI/UX Enhancements**: Responsive React frontend with Shadcn UI, dynamic running banner, updated company My Story section, and a full-width ice background image replacing the falling ice animation in the hero section.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug reported by the user: refreshing the  caused duplicate orders and multiple confirmation emails to be sent. The user explicitly stated, I noticed that when i refreshed the order confirmation page, the payment is processed again and I am getting 2 confirmation emails instead of one. Please fix (Chat Message 479). The AI engineer acknowledged this as a valid issue, stating, Good catch! The issue is that the order confirmation page triggers the webhook every time it loads. Let me fix this by adding a check to prevent duplicate order processing: (Chat Message 480). The current work involves implementing a mechanism to make the order processing on the  idempotent, ensuring that an order is only processed once, even if the page is reloaded multiple times. This will likely involve checking for an existing processed status or a unique session identifier before re-triggering the order fulfillment backend logic.
